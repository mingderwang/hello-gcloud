To run a "Hello World" application in Docker on port 8080, you can follow these steps:

1. First, make sure that Docker is installed on your system.

2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal or command prompt.

3. Create a new file called `Dockerfile` in the directory with the following contents:

```
FROM node:14-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

This Dockerfile uses the official Node.js image from Docker Hub, sets the working directory to `/app`, copies all the files from the current directory into the container's `/app` directory, installs the dependencies using `npm`, exposes port 8080, and runs the `npm start` command.

4. Create a new file called `index.js` in the same directory with the following contents:

```
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '0.0.0.0';
const port = 8080;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

This is a simple Node.js HTTP server that listens on port 8080 and responds with the text "Hello, World!".

5. Build the Docker image by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```
docker build -t my-hello-world-app .
```

This command will build a new Docker image named `my-hello-world-app` based on the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

6. Run the Docker container by running the following command:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-hello-world-app
```

This command will start a new Docker container based on the `my-hello-world-app` image and map port 8080 in the container to port 8080 on the host machine.

7. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the text "Hello, World!" displayed in your browser.

That's it! You have successfully run a "Hello World" application in Docker on port 8080.
